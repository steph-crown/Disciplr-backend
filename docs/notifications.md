# Notification Delivery System

The application uses an abstraction for notification delivery, allowing for multiple providers (Email, Console, etc.) and reliable delivery via background jobs.

## Architecture

1.  **Job Enqueueing**: Notifications are enqueued as `notification.send` jobs.
2.  **Job Execution**: The job handler uses an injected `NotificationService` instance to select and execute the configured provider.
3.  **Retries**: Jobs are automatically retried with exponential backoff on failure.

## Provider Interface

All providers must implement the `NotificationProvider` interface:

```typescript
export interface NotificationProvider {
  name: string
  send(recipient: string, subject: string, body: string): Promise<void>
}
```

## Configuration

The active provider is selected at boot via the validated `NOTIFICATION_PROVIDER` environment variable and injected through `src/index.ts` → `src/app-bootstrap.ts` → `BackgroundJobSystem`.
Available providers:
- `email`: Sends via Email (Stub implementation).
- `console`: Logs to console (Default for local development).

### Fail-fast behavior

- `NotificationService` is initialized with a provider registry and a default provider name.
- If the configured provider name is unknown, startup fails with an explicit error.
- If a runtime override requests an unknown provider, the send operation throws immediately.
- Silent fallback to `console` for unknown provider names is intentionally removed to avoid masking misconfiguration.

## Milestone Reminders

The system sends deadline-approaching reminders for active vault milestones. These reminders are sent at configurable lead times before the milestone's due date.

### Lead Time Configuration

By default, reminders are sent at three intervals:
- 72 hours before the deadline
- 24 hours before the deadline
- 1 hour before the deadline

You can customize the lead times by passing an array of millisecond values to the `sendMilestoneReminders` function or the `milestone.reminders` job payload:

```typescript
// Example: Send reminders 48 hours, 12 hours, and 30 minutes before deadline
sendMilestoneReminders({
  leadTimesMs: [
    48 * 60 * 60 * 1000,  // 48 hours
    12 * 60 * 60 * 1000,  // 12 hours
    30 * 60 * 1000        // 30 minutes
  ]
})
```

### Reminder Deduplication

Reminders are deduplicated using an idempotency key, ensuring only one reminder is sent per lead time bucket per milestone, even if the job runs multiple times.

### Notification Type

Milestone reminders use the `milestone_reminder` notification type and include:
- Milestone title
- Time remaining until deadline
- Vault ID
- Milestone ID
- Due date

## Observability

- **Metrics**: Queue metrics can be accessed via `GET /api/jobs/metrics`.
- **Logs**: Job execution is logged. PII (recipient, subject, body) is filtered from the logs for security and compliance.
- **Failures**: Persistent failures are recorded and observable via the metrics endpoint.

## Retry Policy

The system uses an exponential backoff strategy:
- `delay = min(60s, 1s * 2^(attempt - 1))`
- Execution is observable via `/api/jobs/metrics` and failures are tracked with their error messages.

## Digest Batching

Starting with the digest feature, milestone reminders can be batched into digests. Instead of receiving separate notifications for each approaching milestone, users receive a single consolidated notification containing all milestones due within the configured lead times.

### Digest Content

A digest notification includes:
- Count of milestones approaching
- For each milestone:
  - Milestone title
  - Time remaining until deadline
  - Associated vault ID

### Digest Idempotency

Digests use composite idempotency keys:
- Individual milestones: `milestone-in-digest-{milestoneId}-{leadTimeMs}`
- Digest notifications: `digest-reminders-{userId}-{runMinute}`

This ensures a milestone never appears in multiple digests within the same run.

### Jobs

Two jobs handle digest reminders:
- `milestone.reminders.digest` - Collects and sends/defers digests
- `milestone.reminders.deferred` - Processes deferred reminders after quiet hours

Recommended scheduler configuration:
```
milestone.reminders.digest:    every 15 minutes
milestone.reminders.deferred:  every 5 minutes
```

## Quiet-Hours Windowing

Users can configure quiet hours during which no notifications are delivered. Reminders falling within quiet hours are deferred to the next allowed delivery window.

### Configuration

Users configure quiet hours via the `/api/users/me/notification-preferences` endpoint:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| timezone | string | UTC | IANA timezone identifier (e.g., "America/New_York") |
| quiet_hours_enabled | boolean | false | Enable/disable quiet hours |
| quiet_hours_start | string | 22:00 | Local time when quiet hours begin (HH:MM format) |
| quiet_hours_end | string | 08:00 | Local time when quiet hours end (HH:MM format) |

### API Endpoints

```
GET  /api/users/me/notification-preferences   - Get current preferences
PUT  /api/users/me/notification-preferences   - Update preferences
DELETE /api/users/me/notification-preferences - Reset to defaults
```

### Example Request

```json
PUT /api/users/me/notification-preferences
{
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "quiet_hours_enabled": true,
  "quiet_hours_start": "22:00",
  "quiet_hours_end": "08:00"
}
```

### Deferral Behavior

- Reminders are **never dropped**; they are stored in `deferred_reminders` table
- Deferred reminders are delivered at the next allowed time (when quiet hours end)
- DST transitions are handled automatically using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
- The `milestone.reminders.deferred` job processes deferred reminders periodically

### Example Timeline

User in `America/New_York` with quiet hours 22:00-08:00:

| UTC Time | NYC Local | Event |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| 02:30 UTC | 22:30 EDT | Reminder generated, deferred |
| 12:00 UTC | 08:00 EDT | Deferred reminder delivered |

### DST Handling

The quiet-hours system uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` for timezone-aware calculations, which automatically handles:
- Spring-forward DST transitions (skipped hour)
- Fall-back DST transitions (repeated hour)
- Timezones without DST (e.g., UTC, Asia/Kolkata)
