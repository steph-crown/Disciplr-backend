# Implementation Plan: Horizon Listener → Database Sync

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the Horizon Listener → Database Sync feature into discrete, testable coding tasks. The approach follows a bottom-up strategy: first establishing the database schema and core data models, then building the parsing and processing logic, and finally wiring everything together with the Horizon listener service. Each task builds incrementally on previous work, with property-based tests integrated close to implementation to catch errors early.

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Property tests use fast-check with minimum 100 iterations per test
- All database operations use transactions for atomicity
- Retry logic distinguishes between transient and non-retryable errors
- Graceful shutdown ensures in-flight events complete before termination
- Configuration validation happens at startup to fail fast
- Dead letter queue enables manual investigation and reprocessing of failed events
