# Disciplr Soroban Contracts

On-chain programmable, time-locked capital vaults for accountability staking,
the chain-side counterpart to the `disciplr-backend` API and Horizon listener.

## accountability_vault

Implements the vault lifecycle that the backend models off-chain in
`src/services/vaultTransitions.ts` and parses events for in
`src/services/eventParser.ts`:

| Function        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `create_vault`  | Create a `Draft` vault with milestones, verifier, and success/failure destinations. Validates amount, deadline, and that milestone amounts sum to the total. |
| `stake`         | Creator transfers the SEP-41 token into the contract; `Draft` -> `Active`.                                                                                   |
| `check_in`      | Designated verifier confirms a milestone before its `due_date`.                                                                                              |
| `slash_on_miss` | After the deadline with unverified milestones, slash funds to `failure_destination`; `Active` -> `Failed`.                                                   |
| `claim`         | When all milestones are verified, release funds to `success_destination`; `Active` -> `Completed`.                                                           |
| `withdraw`      | Cancel/refund an unfunded or unstarted vault to the creator; -> `Cancelled`.                                                                                 |
| `get_vault`     | Read-only accessor for the current vault record.                                                                                                             |

### Role-separation invariant

`create_vault` enforces that `creator != verifier`. Allowing the same address to
fill both roles would let one party both stake funds *and* self-confirm milestones,
completely undermining the accountability guarantee. Any attempt to create a vault
where `creator == verifier` returns `Error::CreatorIsVerifier` (code 26).

The `VaultStatus` enum (`Draft`/`Active`/`Completed`/`Failed`/`Cancelled`)
mirrors `PersistedVault.status` in `src/types/vaults.ts`. Emitted events
(`vault_created`, `vault_staked`, `milestone_checked_in`, `vault_slashed`,
`vault_completed`, `vault_cancelled`, `vault_withdrawn`) align with the topics
consumed by the backend event parser.

**Error Handling and Backend Recoverability:**
Contract read operations (like `get_vault`) and state transitions (`stake`, `check_in`, `claim`) safely return `Error::NotInitialized` rather than panicking when a `vault_id` is unset in storage. The backend's `src/middleware/errorHandler.ts` relies on this typed error mapping (specifically to `ErrorCode.NOT_FOUND` with status code 404) to gracefully recover from pre-initialization read attempts.

## Build & test

```bash
# from the contracts/ directory
stellar contract build
cargo test

# Check that the compiled contract stays within the allowed size budget
# Fails if the .wasm artifact exceeds the 100KB budget (configurable via MAX_WASM_SIZE)
bash build-size-check.sh
```

### Wasm Size Budget Configuration

To prevent accidental bloat in the smart contract, the `accountability_vault` includes a size budget check (`build-size-check.sh`) integrated into the CI pipeline.
The default limit is set to **100,000 bytes** (~100KB).

If you need to update this budget as the contract grows:

1. Temporarily increase the budget locally by exporting the variable: `export MAX_WASM_SIZE=150000`
2. Update the default value in `contracts/build-size-check.sh`
3. Push the changes to update the CI limit.

## Backend integration

`src/services/soroban.ts` calls `create_vault` via the Stellar SDK
(`@stellar/stellar-sdk` v14). The Horizon listener
(`src/services/horizonListener.ts`) and `src/services/eventParser.ts`
ingest the events emitted by these functions to keep the off-chain vault state
in sync.

## Deterministic vault address derivation

Each vault is deployed as its own contract instance. The address is derived
deterministically from the deployer address and a 32-byte salt, so
`src/services/soroban.ts` can correlate the on-chain address to the off-chain
`PersistedVault.id` **before** the deploy transaction is confirmed.

### Derivation formula

```
contract_address = sha256("contract" || deployer_bytes || salt_bytes)
```

This is Soroban's built-in CREATE2-style address scheme. It can be computed
client-side using `env.deployer().with_address(deployer, salt).deployed_address()`
in Rust tests, or via the Stellar SDK `Contract.fromAddress` / deployer helpers
in TypeScript.

### Salt convention (backend)

```
salt = sha256(vault_id)   // 32-byte hash of the off-chain UUID string
```

See `src/services/soroban.ts` → `saltFromVaultId`.

### Properties

| Property | Guarantee |
|---|---|
| Same `(deployer, salt)` | Always yields the same address |
| Different `salt` | Different address (distinct vault UUIDs → distinct contracts) |
| Different `deployer` | Different address (multi-tenant safe) |

The test suite in `contracts/accountability_vault/src/test.rs`
(`test_deterministic_address_*`) exercises all three properties and verifies
that `deployed_address()` matches the address of the actually deployed contract.
