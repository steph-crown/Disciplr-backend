## Accountability Vault

The `accountability_vault` contract implements time-locked capital vaults on Stellar with milestone-based release conditions.

### Overview

The accountability vault allows users to:
- Host multiple independent vaults on a single contract deployment, keyed by a unique `vault_id`
- Lock funds in a vault with a total amount
- Define milestones with individual amounts that must sum to the total
- Specify a set of verifiers (M-of-N threshold) authorized to validate milestone completion
- Set a guardian address that can pause/unpause the vault in emergencies
- Set success and failure destinations for fund release
- Allow reclaiming residual (dust) token balances to the creator after settlement

### Security Invariants

#### Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) Pattern

`slash_on_miss`, `claim`, and `withdraw` (active-vault path) all update and persist vault
state — setting `status` to the terminal value and zeroing `staked` — **before** executing
the external `token::Client::transfer` call. This ensures the vault reaches a terminal state
even if the downstream token call panics or re-enters the contract.

```rust
// CEI: capture transfer values, update and persist state, then call external token.
let slashed = vault.staked;
let failure_destination = vault.failure_destination.clone();
vault.status = VaultStatus::Failed;
vault.staked = 0;
env.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::Vault, &vault);   // ← state committed

token::Client::new(&env, &token_addr).transfer(          // ← external call last
    &env.current_contract_address(),
    &failure_destination,
    &slashed,
);
```

#### Emergency Pause (Guardian Role)

A `guardian` address is set at `create_vault` time. The guardian may call:

- `emergency_pause(guardian)` — blocks `slash_on_miss`, `claim`, and active-vault
  `withdraw` while a dispute or incident is investigated.
- `emergency_unpause(guardian)` — re-enables normal operations.

Only the address stored as `vault.guardian` may call these functions; any other address is
rejected with `Error::Unauthorized`. Draft-vault cancellation via `withdraw` is not affected
by the pause flag, as it involves no token transfer.

#### M-of-N Verifier Approvals

`check_in` supports a configurable set of verifiers and an `approval_threshold` (M-of-N).
A milestone is flipped to `verified` only once at least `approval_threshold` distinct
addresses from the verifier set (or the optional oracle) have approved it.

- Double-approval by the same address returns `Error::AlreadyApproved`.
- Approvals are tracked per-milestone in `DataKey::MilestoneApprovals(index)`.
- The threshold must be ≥ 1 and ≤ `verifiers.len()`; otherwise `create_vault` returns
  `Error::InvalidThreshold`.

#### Evidence Hash Binding

`check_in` accepts an `evidence_hash: BytesN<32>` parameter — a 32-byte digest (e.g.
SHA-256) of the off-chain evidence artifact (document, IPFS CID, etc.). When the
approval threshold is reached, the hash is persisted alongside the check-in timestamp
under `DataKey::CheckIn(index)` as a `(u64, BytesN<32>)` tuple and emitted in the
`milestone_checked_in` event value so that the on-chain record is cryptographically bound
to the off-chain evidence.

```rust
// event topics: ("milestone_checked_in", caller, source)
// event value:  (milestone_index, evidence_hash)
env.events().publish(
    (String::from_str(&env, "milestone_checked_in"), caller, source),
    (milestone_index, evidence_hash),
);
```

The backend `submitCheckIn(vaultId, milestoneId, evidenceHash)` passes the hex-encoded
hash, which is decoded to `BytesN<32>` before calling the contract.

### Arithmetic Safety

The `create_vault` function validates that milestone amounts are positive and sum exactly to
the declared `amount`, rejecting mismatches with `Error::AmountMismatch`.

### Checked Milestone Access

Contract code must not use `unwrap()` when reading milestones by caller-supplied indexes.
Even when a nearby bounds check exists, use checked access such as
`vault.milestones.get(index).ok_or(Error::MilestoneIndexOutOfRange)?` so future
refactors continue to return typed contract errors instead of risking host-level panics.

### Error Types

| Code | Name | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | Vault storage already set |
| 2 | `NotInitialized` | Vault not yet created |
| 3 | `InvalidAmount` | Zero or negative amount |
| 4 | `InvalidDeadline` | Deadline in the past or milestone exceeds vault end |
| 5 | `NoMilestones` | Empty milestone list |
| 6 | `NotDraft` | Expected Draft state |
| 7 | `NotActive` | Expected Active state |
| 8 | `Unauthorized` | Caller not permitted |
| 9 | `AlreadyStaked` | Vault already funded |
| 10 | `MilestoneIndexOutOfRange` | Index beyond milestone list |
| 11 | `MilestoneAlreadyVerified` | Milestone already at threshold |
| 12 | `DeadlinePassed` | Operation rejected after deadline |
| 13 | `DeadlineNotReached` | Slash attempted before deadline |
| 14 | `MilestonesIncomplete` | Not all milestones verified |
| 15 | `NothingToWithdraw` | Staked balance is zero |
| 16 | `AmountMismatch` | Received amount less than declared |
| 17 | `InsufficientAllowance` | Spender allowance below vault amount |
| 18 | `Paused` | Operation blocked by guardian pause |
| 19 | `AlreadyApproved` | Address has already approved this milestone |
| 20 | `NoVerifiers` | Empty verifier list |
| 21 | `InvalidThreshold` | Threshold is 0 or exceeds verifier count |
| 22 | `StakedRemaining` | Reclaim attempted while stake is non-zero |
| 23 | `VaultDisputed` | Operation rejected because vault is in `Disputed` state |

### Performance & Gas Benchmarks

To ensure predictable scaling and prevent out-of-gas exploits or transaction failures, the
contract has built-in performance bounds.

#### Storage Reads & Complexity Analysis

- **Milestone Iteration**: Functions like `claim` and `slash_on_miss` iterate over the
  `milestones` vector. CPU and Memory usage scale linearly (O(N)) with the milestone count N.
- **Flat Storage Access**: The storage layout guarantees flat (O(1)) read footprint. There
  are no redundant storage reads or nested lookups within loops.
- **Gas Bounded Growth**: CPU and Memory bounds are actively asserted in test suites to
  catch regressions before deployment.

#### Documented Footprint Thresholds (10 Milestones Baseline)

| Function | CPU Cost Threshold (Instructions) | Memory Cost Threshold (Bytes) |
|----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `create_vault` | < 600,000 | < 200,000 |
| `stake` | < 700,000 | < 200,000 |
| `check_in` | < 300,000 | < 100,000 |
| `claim` | < 900,000 | < 250,000 |
| `slash_on_miss` | < 900,000 | < 250,000 |

### Events

The contract emits `soroban_sdk::Symbol`-typed topics on every state transition.
Symbols are cheaper than `String` on Soroban (lower CPU/memory cost) and are the
idiomatic choice for event keys.

Short topics (≤ 9 characters) use `symbol_short!`; longer topics use
`Symbol::new`.  Both are decoded to plain UTF-8 strings by `scValToNative` in the
Stellar SDK, so off-chain consumers see ordinary strings.

| Symbol topic (on-chain)    | Emitted by                  | Decoded string value       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| `Symbol::new("vault_created")`    | `create_vault`       | `"vault_created"`          |
| `Symbol::new("vault_staked")`     | `stake`, `stake_from`| `"vault_staked"`           |
| `Symbol::new("milestone_checked_in")` | `check_in`       | `"milestone_checked_in"`   |
| `symbol_short!("oracle")`         | `check_in` (source)  | `"oracle"`                 |
| `symbol_short!("verifier")`       | `check_in` (source)  | `"verifier"`               |
| `Symbol::new("deadline_extended")` | `extend_deadline`   | `"deadline_extended"`      |
| `Symbol::new("vault_slashed")`    | `slash_on_miss`      | `"vault_slashed"`          |
| `Symbol::new("vault_completed")`  | `claim`, `claim_milestone` | `"vault_completed"`  |
| `Symbol::new("vault_cancelled")`  | `withdraw` (Draft)   | `"vault_cancelled"`        |
| `Symbol::new("vault_withdrawn")`  | `withdraw` (Active)  | `"vault_withdrawn"`        |
| `Symbol::new("vault_paused")`     | `emergency_pause`    | `"vault_paused"`           |
| `Symbol::new("vault_unpaused")`   | `emergency_unpause`  | `"vault_unpaused"`         |
| `Symbol::new("milestone_claimed")` | `claim_milestone`   | `"milestone_claimed"`      |

The `eventParser.ts` service maps contract Symbol topic strings to the canonical
`EventType` used by the backend:

```
vault_slashed   → vault_failed    (slash = failure destination settled)
vault_withdrawn → vault_cancelled (active withdraw = cancelled state)
```

Informational topics (`vault_staked`, `milestone_checked_in`, `deadline_extended`,
`vault_paused`, `vault_unpaused`, `milestone_claimed`) are acknowledged by the
parser and silently skipped rather than treated as parse errors.

### Building and Testing

#### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Soroban CLI tools

#### Build

```bash
cd contracts/accountability_vault
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

#### Test

```bash
cd contracts/accountability_vault
cargo test
```

### Migration: API change (cancel_vault vs withdraw)

- The contract API now exposes `cancel_vault(vault_id, creator)` for explicitly
  cancelling an unfunded `Draft` vault. This path emits the `vault_cancelled`
  event and performs no token transfers.
- The `withdraw(vault_id, creator)` function has been restricted to the funded
  `Active` refund case (vaults that were staked but never had any verified
  check-ins). It performs a CEI-safe refund to the `creator` and emits
  `vault_withdrawn`.
- Backend callers must choose the appropriate method based on the vault's
  current `status`: use `cancel_vault` for `Draft`, and `withdraw` for
  `Active` refunding. The `vault_cancelled` topic and payload remain
  compatible with the existing backend event parser.


#### Formatting

The workspace ships a `contracts/rustfmt.toml` config. Format all contract sources with:

```bash
cd contracts
cargo fmt
```

#### Lint

The workspace enables `clippy::all` warnings via `[workspace.lints.clippy]` in
`contracts/Cargo.toml`. Run clippy with warnings treated as errors:

```bash
cd contracts
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

To suppress known false-positives in generated Soroban SDK code, add
`#[allow(clippy::...)]` at the item level rather than disabling workspace-wide.

#### Test Coverage

The contract maintains comprehensive test coverage including:

- Normal vault lifecycle (create, stake, check-in, claim, slash, withdraw)
- CEI ordering invariants: terminal state committed before token transfer
- Emergency pause/unpause: guardian blocks and re-enables settlement paths
- M-of-N verifier approvals: partial approvals, full threshold, double-approval rejection
- Allowance-based staking (`stake_from`)
- Oracle-driven milestone verification
- Joint deadline extension (`extend_deadline`)
- Disputed state: `admin_dispute` enters hold, `admin_resolve` returns to Active/Completed/Failed, `slash_on_miss` and `claim` blocked while disputed
- Gas benchmarks with hard CPU/memory bounds
- **Claim auth-chain assertions**: `env.auths()` snapshots verifying the recorded authorizer
  matches the claim caller, separately for the creator path and the verifier path

#### Auth-Chain Assertion Pattern

The `claim` function may be called by either the vault creator or any member of the verifier
set. Two dedicated tests in `test.rs` lock down this invariant using `env.auths()` snapshots
rather than a blanket `mock_all_auths`:

**Why `env.auths()`?**
`env.auths()` returns the list of `(Address, AuthorizedInvocation)` pairs that were recorded
during the most recent contract call. Asserting on this list proves that the contract called
`Address::require_auth()` for exactly the address that was passed as `caller`, and not for a
different address. This catches bugs where `require_auth()` is called on the wrong variable
or is missing entirely.

**How the tests work:**

1. Setup (`create_vault`, `stake`, `check_in`) runs under `env.mock_all_auths()` so token
   operations succeed without requiring real signatures.
2. `claim` is invoked with either `creator` or `verifier` as the caller.
3. `env.auths()` is inspected immediately after the call. The test asserts:
   - Exactly one auth entry was recorded.
   - The authorized address equals the claim caller.
   - The authorized function matches `claim(vault_id, caller)` exactly.

```rust
// After contract.claim(&vault_id, &creator):
let recorded = env.auths();
assert_eq!(recorded.len(), 1);
let (addr, invocation) = &recorded[0];
assert_eq!(addr, &creator);
assert_eq!(invocation.function, AuthorizedFunction::Contract((
    contract_id.clone(),
    Symbol::new(&env, "claim"),
    (vault_id.clone(), creator.clone()).into_val(&env),
)));
```

**Helper function:** `assert_claim_auth(env, contract_id, vault_id, caller)` encapsulates
this check and is shared by both the creator and verifier path tests, keeping each test
focused on the setup path that distinguishes them.

**What is NOT tested here:** The tests do not assert on auth entries from `stake` or
`check_in` because those calls happen in setup before the `env.auths()` snapshot is taken.
`env.auths()` only reflects the most recent invocation.

### Deployment

Deploy the contract to Soroban testnet or mainnet using the Soroban CLI:

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/accountability_vault.wasm \
  --source <your-secret-key> \
  --network <network-passphrase>
```

### Security Considerations

1. **CEI Pattern**: All token transfers occur after state is persisted to storage.
2. **Emergency Pause**: Guardian can halt settlement paths during disputes.
3. **M-of-N Verification**: No single verifier can unilaterally release funds when
   `approval_threshold > 1`.
4. **Overflow Protection**: Milestone amount summation uses safe integer arithmetic.
5. **Input Validation**: All amounts validated for positivity; milestone amounts must sum
   exactly to the vault amount.
6. **Authorized Operations**: Creator, verifier set, guardian, and oracle roles are
   enforced via `Address::require_auth()`.

### Residual Sweep (reclaim_after_settlement)

The contract exposes `reclaim_after_settlement(token_address)` to sweep any residual token
balance (dust or rounding remainders) held by the contract back to the vault creator.

Requirements:

- Caller must be the vault `creator` (authorization enforced via `require_auth`).
- The vault must have no staked funds remaining (`staked == 0`); otherwise
  `Error::StakedRemaining` is returned.

The function queries the contract's token balance via `token::Client::balance` and performs
a `token::Client::transfer` of the full balance to the creator.

## Accountability Vault - Key Behaviors

### Timestamp Boundary Rules
- `slash_on_miss`: 
  - `env.ledger().timestamp() <= vault.end_timestamp` → Returns `DeadlineNotReached` (exact equality is **rejected**)
  - `env.ledger().timestamp() > vault.end_timestamp` → Slash is executed
- `check_in`:
  - Exact equality (`timestamp == milestone.due_date`) is **allowed** and succeeds.

### Check-in Idempotency (#502)
- Calling `check_in` multiple times on the same milestone index returns `MilestoneAlreadyVerified` error on subsequent calls.
- This behavior is **intentional** and expected by the backend (`eventParser.ts`).

These rules are enforced through boundary and idempotency tests in `contracts/accountability_vault/src/test.rs`.
